    <p>Hi my name is Daniel.C.Ajufoh but my friends call me Danny.I am a guy with lots of issues, from the testimony of my friends i use to be this nice calm gentle person but how i changed baffles them alot well i dont blame them one bit. Things has changed for my family ever since we lost a friend, a daughhter and a sister <style="font-size: 15px;">&#128120it has been some what hard these past few monnths but we thank God for every thing.It has not been easy some say that we'll deal or get use to her presence in time but I just stare at them in disbelif knowing of a fact that they can't understand the seeries of moments I had with my sister, never understand what she means to me.   </p>
